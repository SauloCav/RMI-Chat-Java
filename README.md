# RMI Chat Java

Java RMI is a mechanism to allow the invocation of methods that reside in different Java Virtual Machines (JVM). The JVM can be on different machines or they can be on the same machine. In either case, the method can be executed at a different address than the calling process. Java RMI is an object-oriented remote procedure call mechanism.<br/><br/>
An RMI application is often composed of two different programs, a server and a client. The server creates remote objects and makes references to those objects available. Then it is valid for clients to invoke its methods on the objects. The client performs remote references to remote objects on the server and invokes methods on those remote objects.<br/>
The RMI model provides a distributed object application for the programmer. It is a communication mechanism between the server and the client to communicate and transmit information to each other.<br/><br/>
