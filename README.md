# RMI-Chat-Java

Java RMI is a mechanism to allow the invocation of methods that reside in different Java Virtual Machines (JVM). The JVM can be on different machines or they can be on the same machine. In either case, the method can be executed at a different address than the calling process. Java RMI is an object-oriented remote procedure call mechanism.
